{"name":"terraform","version":"0.1.2","description":"Installs Terraform (terraform.io)","long_description":"terraform Cookbook\n==================\n\nInstalls [Terraform][terraform] by Mitchell Hashimoto\n([@mitchellh](https://github.com/mitchellh)).\n\n[Terraform][terraform] is an open source tool that allows you to\nconfigure entire infrastructure stack as code.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n### Cookbooks\n\nThe only dependency this cookbook has is the [ark\ncookbook](https://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/ark).\n\n### Platforms\n\nThe following platforms are supported and have been automatically tested under\n[Test Kitchen][testkitchen]:\n\n* Amazon Linux (2014.03.2-hvm)\n* CentOS 6.5\n* CentOS 7\n* Debian 7.6\n* Fedora 20\n* FreeBSD 10\n* Ubuntu 14.04\n\nOther versions of these OSs should work. Alternative Debian and RHEL\nfamily distributions are also assumed to work. Please [report][issues]\nany additional platforms you have tested so they can be added.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nSimply include `recipe[terraform]` in your run_list to have\n[Terraform][terraform] installed.\n\nRecipes\n-------\n\n### default\n\nInstalls [Terraform][terraform] from official pre-compiled binaries.\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\n### version\n\nThe version of [Terraform][terraform] that will be installed.\n\n### raw_checksums\n\nsha256 checksums for the intended version's archive file, used for security and\nshould be changed alongside version.\n\n_NOTE: All other attributes are considered internal and shouldn't\nnormally need to be changed._\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\n* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]\n* Report issues/questions/feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]\n\n### Contributing\n\nPull requests are very welcome! Ideally create a topic branch for every\nseparate change you make.\n\nThis cookbook uses [ChefSpec][chefspec] for unit tests. I also use [Food\nCritic][foodcritic] and [RuboCop][rubocop] to check for style issues.\nWhen contributing it would be very helpful if you could run these via\n`bundle exec spec` and `bundle exec style`.\n\nLastly, there are [Serverspec][serverspec] integration tests for\nuse with [Test Kitchen][testkitchen]. To see all of the available\nintegration test suites just check `bundle exec rake T` or `bundle exec\nkitchen list`. It would be great if you could run these tests too, you\nmay however leave out the Amazon Linux test suite if you do not have\nan AWS account as it runs on an EC2 instance (you will be billed for\nrunning this).\n\n### Credit\n\nThis cookbook, especially the checksum stuff in\nattributes file has been influenced by the [Packer\ncookbook](https://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/packer) by\n[@sit](https://github.com/sit).\n\n### License and Author\n\nAuthor:: [Ross Timson][rosstimson]\n<[ross@rosstimson.com](mailto:ross@rosstimson.com)>\n\nCopyright 2014, Ross Timson\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n\n[rosstimson]:         https://github.com/rosstimson\n[repo]:               https://github.com/rosstimson/chef-terraform\n[issues]:             https://github.com/rosstimson/chef-terraform/issues\n[terraform]:          http://www.terraform.io\n[chefsepc]:           https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec\n[foodcritic]:         https://github.com/acrmp/foodcritic\n[rubocop]:            https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop\n[serverspec]:         https://github.com/serverspec/serverspec\n[testkitchen]:        https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen\n","maintainer":"Ross Timson","maintainer_email":"ross@rosstimson.com","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"centos":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","fedora":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"ark":">= 0.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{}}
